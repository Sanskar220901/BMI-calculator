# BMI-calculator
The Body Max Index (BMI) calculator measures your body size based on your weight and height. The excel worksheet displays the table starting at 5 ft and ending at 6’4 ft. The table starts at 5 ft and ends at 6+ feet since that is the most common height range amongst individuals across age groups. There is a button on the top left corner, labeled “Run BMI Calculator”. After that button is clicked, the information is displayed in which the user must input the corresponding values: Name, Date (Format is MM/DD/YYYY), Height (in meters) and Weight (in KGs). After the user has input the data, clicking “Calculate BMI” on the bottom left displays the users BMI based on the users input. “Generate Chart” displays the information and color codes the chart according to the legend. “Add to Database” displays the information on an empty table on ACCESS file which displays the data and calculates inputs for multiple users. Finally, “Generate Report” creates a report on a word document from all the data input in a table.
